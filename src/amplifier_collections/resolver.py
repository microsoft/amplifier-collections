"""Collection resolver - Resolve collection names to paths.

CRITICAL (KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY): Search paths are app policy, not library mechanism.

Per KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY:
- "Could two teams want different behavior?" â†’ YES (search order is policy)
- Different apps could resolve collections differently
- Kernel doesn't know about collections

Per AGENTS.md: Ruthless simplicity - direct filesystem checks, no caching complexity.

REFACTORED from CLI: Search paths must be injected by app, not hardcoded.
