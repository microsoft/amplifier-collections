"""Collection resolver - Resolve collection names to paths.

CRITICAL (KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY): Search paths are app policy, not library mechanism.

Per KERNEL_PHILOSOPHY:
- "Could two teams want different behavior?" â†’ YES (search order is policy)
- Different apps could resolve collections differently
- Kernel doesn't know about collections

Per AGENTS.md: Ruthless simplicity - direct filesystem checks, no caching complexity.

REFACTORED from CLI: Search paths must be injected by app, not hardcoded.

    Resolve collection names to installation paths (with injected search paths).

    This class implements mechanism for resolving names. Apps inject POLICY (search paths).

    Different applications could:
    - Use different search orders
    - Add custom search locations
    - Implement different precedence rules

    Philosophy:
    - Simple, direct filesystem checks
    - No caching (YAGNI - optimize if needed later)
    - Clear error messages
